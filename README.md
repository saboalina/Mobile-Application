# Mobile-Application

Access App

A private corporation is managing its employee access using a mobile application. The security staff is maintaining the access details and the employees are able to view and use their
credentials to gain access.
On the server-side at least the following details are maintained:
  - Id - the internal rule id. Integer value greater than zero.
  - Name - A string of characters representing the access rule name.
  - Level - Integer value greater than zero, representing the security level.
  - Status - A string of characters representing the status. Eg. “prepared”, “in-use”, “canceled”, “old”, etc.
  - From - An integer value representing the beginning (eg. 1610985064), when the rule is in the specified status.
  - To - An integer value representing the end, when the rule is in the specified status.
The application should provide the following features (available without restarting the app):

● Staff Section (separate activity)
  a. Register a new rule. Using POST /rule call by specifying all the rule details. Available online and offline.
  b. View all the rules found in the system, in a list. Using GET /rules call, the staff will retrieve all of them. The list should display at least the id, name, and level. If offline, the app will display an offline message and a way to retry the connection and the call. Once the list is retrieved it should be available offline and online.
  c. By selecting a rule from the list, the staff will be able to view all the rule details. To retrieve the details GET /rule call will be used by specifying the rule id. Available online only.
  d. Update the rule details. On the details screen, the user will have the option to update all the existing rule fields. Using POST /update call with the new rule details. Available online only.

● Employee Section (separate activity) - Available online only.
  a. View all the rules in a specified time range (from-to). Using the same GET/rules call, the app will retrieve all the rules and will present only the ones included in the specified range.
  b. View all the rules at a specified level. Using GET /level , by specifying the desired level, will display all the received rules. The list should be ordered by from, to, and status fields all ascending.

  On the server-side, once a new rule is added to the system, the server will send, using a WebSocket channel, a message to all the connected clients/applications with the new rule object. Each application, that is connected, will display the received rule details, in human form (not JSON text or toString) using an in-app “notification” (like a snack bar or toast or a dialog on the screen), regardless of the opened screen.
  On all server/DB operations a progress indicator will be displayed.
  On all server/DB interactions, if an error message is generated, the app should display the error message using a toast or snack bar. On all interactions (server or DB calls), a log message should be recorded.
